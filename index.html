     <p><strong>Kauai is the oldest island in the Hawaiian chain, located north of its cousins. ... It's also the greenest of all the Hawaiian islands, and 97 percent of it is covered by forests or mountain ranges. It has the most dramatic landscape in its 4,000-foot-high Na Pali cliffs.</strong>
     </p>
     <p>The Hawaiian islands are known for raging waterfalls, but Kauai is home to one of the wettest places on earth. Mount Waialeale has dozens of falls that pour into a deep canyon accessible via hike.</p>
     <h3 id="kauai">There are many things you can do in Kauai. Some of the things include- </h3>
    
<ul>     
<li> <strong> Go swimming at the beautiful beaches!</strong> Although the waters can at times be rough, they are beautiful, and fish are abundant.</li>

         <li> <strong> Learn about the history of the island!</strong> Hawaii has quite a lot of history, as it did not originate as a United State. It was bought later on, while there were many tribes still living there. There are many tribes that lived on kauai, and you can still visit their tribe land today!</li>

         <li> <strong>Take a boat tour to the Na Pali Coast!</strong> The Na Pali Coast is one of the most famous attractions of kauai, and is rightfully so. It is a beautiful, dramatic coast line that is also home to the "graveyard" of the many cheifs that had lived there before. </li>

         <li> <strong>Go to a traditional hawaiian luau!</strong> One of the things that hawaii is known for is their incredible luaus! Luaus are a traditional Hawaiian party or feast that is usually accompanied by entertainment. It may feature food such as poi, kālua puaʻa (kālua pig), poke, lomi salmon, ʻopihi, and haupia, beer, and entertainment such as traditional Hawaiian music and hula.</li>

         </ul>
         <p> <strong>When you travel there, you will might notice that there are <strong>A LOT</strong> of chickens! There is thousands of feral chickens just roaming around the island of kauai, and yes. You do see many chickens crossing the road. And there is a reason for this! There are two popular ideas on why so many chickens roam this island,</strong>
         </p>
         <ol>
             <li class="chickens"><strong>The first suggests the birds are descendants of those that immigrant plantation workers used for cockfighting more than a century ago.</strong></li>
             <br>
             <li class="chickens"><strong>The second, put forth by a team of scientists, claims the proliferation of poultry can be traced to the aftermath of 1992’s Hurricane Iniki, which devastated Kauai, destroying many chicken farms, from which the birds literally flew the coop.</strong>

         </ol>
         <p> There are many more incredible things to see and do at the amazing island of kauai, but you will just have to see them all for yourself! I myself have travelled there, and is still one of my fondest memories of my entire life. I assure you it will be in yours as well. And luckily now they have a direct airline to Kauai versus the former transportation of the airport in Maui, then taking a smaller plane to Kauai.
